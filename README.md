# Data Intergration Part

1. I have combined the data from the JSON  and the CSV files by identifying the common columns of both the datasets.
2. For movies which occur in both the CSV as well as the JSON data, only keep one entry of that movie and delete the duplicate values. 
3. After combining the datasets, I have to gather 1 movie user review for every movie.
4. Created dataset will be then used as a database from which movie data will be fetched whenever a user searches for a movie on the web application.
